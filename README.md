# Project in TMA4320: Introduction to Scientific Computation.
## Project 1: Biophysics

Introduction:

This project is separated into two parts; first we want to perform a simple simulation of how differently charged monomers behave in a 2D solution, and second we will use and compare this to a solution with uniformly charged polymers. Polymers are simulated as a group of monomers of the same charge that are bound together with covalent bonds. The objective is to examine how the mono/polymers cluster under different temperatures. We examine this by a monte carlo simulation where the probability of two particles forming a group is dependent on their charge relative to the temperature, higher temperatures giving a smaller probability of differently charged mono/polymers staying together.

Alongside these simulations we calculate the potential energy of the system, where larger clusters correspond to a smaller potential energy of the system. For a qualitative examination of our monte carlo simulation, we plotted the potential energy of a system for both 200K and 500K, comparing the equilibria levels and obtaining an estimate for the steps needed to reach equilibrium. For two random groups of monomers we plotted the mean cluster size at ten different temperatures from 100K to 1000K, after a number of steps deemed to bring us qualitatively close enough to equilibrium. In part two we perform similar simulations for groups of monomers.

Note: This report is written partly in norwegian and english, most of the comments throughout are in english, however the introduction is not. Hence, the introduction has here been translated into english.
